This is a project I did partly for class, and partly for fun and for 
learning more about gtk/glade with Haskell.

This program can generate RSA public keys, and can encrypt and 
decrypt text files with them. 
Note well: This is not, nor is meant to currently be, industry
strength RSA. I might implement that in the future, or just 
make this be a front end for the existing RSA library implementation.

Installing with cabal should be straightforward. Just download the
file tree and run:
cabal configure
cabal build

and then either cabal install to install it in your bin, or just
run the exe located at ./dist/build/LambdaCrypt/LambdaCrypt
