This program is mainly created for me to experiment with gtk3/glade on Haskell.
It's my first git project, so it has the additional purpose of learning the
git interface to get involved with some open source projects. If you're
reading this, and interested in working on some sort of open source project
together, feel free to let me know. My e-mail address is nathantjcc@gmail.com,
and I'm interested in game programing, ai, and evolutionary algorithms.


As for this particular code, it uses a simply RSA algorithm for encrypting/
decrypting text files. It also generates public/private key pairs.
